## "Deepfake" Is It Really Dangerous ?

### The Present Scenario 

With the rapid development of AI falsified videos developed through neural networks have lead to the disconcerting problem of online disinformation . In the recent years  convincing deep fakes or fake videos appears to be so real that there is no way to know what's factual or not .

Several deep fake videos have gone viral recently, giving millions around the world their first taste of this new technology: President Obama using an expletive to describe President Trump, Mark Zuckerberg admitting that Facebook's true goal is to manipulate and exploit its users, Bill Hader morphing into Al Pacino on a late-night talk show .

Anybody who has a computer and access to the internet can technically produce a “deep fake” video, says John Villasenor, professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles.

### What are Deep Fakes 

Deep fakes refer to manipulated videos, or other digital representations produced by sophisticated artificial intelligence, that yield fabricated images and sounds that appear to be real.

In simple terms, deep fakes are  falsified videos made by means of deep learning . They contain  fabricated images and sounds that appear to be real.

(Deep learning is “a subset of AI,” (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation.)

### A Step Ahead To Fight Deep fakes

While AI can be used to make deep fakes, it can also be used to detect them . With the technology becoming accessible to any computer user, more and more researchers are focusing on deep fake detection and looking for a way of regulating it.

Large corporations such as Facebook and  have taken initiatives to detect and remove deep fake videos. The two companies announced earlier this year that they will be collaborating with top universities across the U.S. to create a large database of fake videos for research, according to Reuters.

Even as the technology continues to evolve, these detection techniques “often lag behind the most advanced creation methods.”

### The Question is ...  

> Will people be more likely to believe a deepfake or a detection algorithm that flags the video as fabricated?
